## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are going to be implemented:

- [] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [] Finish all the optional feature and add on animation 
- [] Keep an note on the custom calendar 
- [] pay your friend

## Notes

It's actually really hard to make app layout nice and neat
and I found although storyboard is really convenient. But sometimes code layout in code is much stragight forward.
